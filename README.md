# About

This is a guided workshop in which the class discusses and explores how computers thinks of images and how we can instruct a computer to modify images for us.

Stretch goal for the class is to also see cool/relatable examples of what people use Python for currently.

# Objectives

All students are able to
- Customize and take home their own printed ASCII art
- Understand that computers remember images as pixels

Some students are able to
- Understand that computers loop through pixels and change the color values to apply a filter
- Describe how computers remember color

# Common things to look for

These are just suggestions to help get started!  Help and guide gently students based on what you observe.  Let students take ownership of the process as much as possible, by explaining and pointing without taking over their computer.

Some things to look out for:

- Students entering late
  - Roamers should help catch the students up
- Students learning to hold the `Ctrl` key down and pressing another key (the other key would mainly be `Enter`)
  - Some will try to press them down quickly at the exact same time
    - Guide should share holding the `Ctrl` key for as long as needed and then pressing the `Enter` key
    - Roamers should help with this as needed, encourage neighbors to help teach each other as well
- Navigating the notebook interface
  - Guide should explicitly talk about relevant parts of the notebook interface
  - Guide should slowly and explicitly narrate when moving from code cell to code cell
  - Guide should point out and refer the line numbers (In, Out) on the left margin
  - Roamers should signal to guide if multiple students are behind in the notebook
- Getting image address from Google towards the end of class for custom ASCII art
  - Right click on image and select "Copy Image Address"

- Some image addresses don't load well
  - Help students find a similar image
- Helping students with printing
  - ASCII text result may need to be scaled down to fit for printing
  - This may require us to be more hands on
