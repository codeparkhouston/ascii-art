# About

This is a guided workshop in which the class discusses and explores how computers thinks of images and how we can instruct a computer to modify images for us.

Stretch goal for the class is to also see cool/relatable examples of what people use Python for currently.

# Objectives

All students are able to
- Customize and take home their own printed ASCII art
- Understand that computers remember images as pixels

Some students are able to
- Understand that computers loop through pixels and change the color values to apply a filter
- Describe how computers remember color

# Things to help with

Look out for these things:

- Students learning to hold the `Ctrl` key down and pressing another key (the other key would mainly be `Enter`)
  - Some will try to press them down quickly at the exact same time
    - Guide should share holding the `Ctrl` key for as long as needed and then pressing the `Enter` key
- Navigating the notebook interface
  - Guide should explicitly talk about relevant parts of the notebook interface
  - Guide should slowly and explicitly narrate when moving from code cell to code cell
  - Guide should point out and refer the line numbers (In, Out) on the left margin
- Getting image address from Google towards the end of class for custom ASCII art

- Some image addresses don't load well
  - Help students find a similar image
- Helping students with printing
  - ASCII text result may need to be scaled down to fit for printing
